# CryptAndStream
A php package to encrypt a video (whatever the size), and to stream it then. 
Useful for zero-knowledge encryption (when you want to store your contents in your cloud but prevent your service provider from reading them).

Usage : 
- on encrypt.php, choose the name of your video file and put the url of encrypt.php in your browser to create a encrypted copy of it
- copy paste stream.php in the same folder
- copy paste index.html in the same folder and read the encryped video from your browser
